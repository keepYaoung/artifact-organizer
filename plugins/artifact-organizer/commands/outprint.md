## Step 0 — theme + renderer preference (run first, every invocation)

**When `PREF` is empty below, you MUST prompt the user for theme + renderer via `AskUserQuestion` BEFORE writing the preference file — theme options: `notion` (warm cream + Notion Blue), `linear` (dark-native + indigo), `vercel` (gallery white + Geist), `stripe` (weight-300 luxury + deep navy), `supabase` (dark-native + emerald), `apple` (SF + Apple Blue + true-black dark), `tailwind` (Inter + slate + indigo-600); renderer options: `auto` / `canvas` / `page`. Use the answer to set `THEME` and `RENDERER`. If the user skips or the tool is unavailable, fall back silently to `notion` + `auto`. Color mode is not a setting — every output inlines both light and dark; the toggle button + `prefers-color-scheme` switch them at view time.**

```bash
PREF=""
for p in ./.artifact-organizer/preference.md ~/.artifact-organizer/preference.md; do
  [ -f "$p" ] && { PREF="$p"; break; }
done

if [ -z "$PREF" ]; then
  # See the instruction above — populate from AskUserQuestion or fall back.
  THEME=notion; RENDERER=auto
  mkdir -p ~/.artifact-organizer; PREF=~/.artifact-organizer/preference.md
  printf -- '---\ntheme: %s\nrenderer: %s\ncreated_at: %s\n---\n' \
    "$THEME" "$RENDERER" "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" > "$PREF"
fi

THEME=$(awk    -F': *' '/^theme:/{print $2; exit}'    "$PREF")
RENDERER=$(awk -F': *' '/^renderer:/{print $2; exit}' "$PREF")
[ -z "$THEME" ]    && THEME=notion
[ -z "$RENDERER" ] && RENDERER=auto
```

You are invoking Artifact Organizer's general-purpose renderer. The user asked for:

$ARGUMENTS

## Your workflow

1. **Understand intent.** What is the user trying to communicate visually?
   - Architecture/flow → Mermaid or ArchitectureGrid
   - Comparison → Comparison or DataTable
   - Ordered guidance / milestone recap → StepList
   - Metrics summary → KPICards, Charts, and DataTable
   - Code review → CodeDiff + Callouts
   - Essay-style explanation → Page with Sections, Headings, Prose, and embedded components
   - Repo / project explainer → start diagram-first with `ArchitectureGrid`, `FlowChart`, `Sequence`, or `Mermaid`, then use `FileTree`, `FileCard`, or `AnnotatedCode` as evidence

2. **Read the catalog.** If you are uncertain about any component's schema or props, read `plugins/artifact-organizer/references/catalog.md` BEFORE building the JSON.

3. **Build the A2UI envelope.**

   ```json
   {
     "a2ui_version": "0.9",
     "catalog": "artifact-organizer/v1",
     "is_task_complete": true,
     "parts": [
       {
         "component": "artifact-organizer/Page",
         "props": { "title": "...", "subtitle": "..." },
         "children": [ /* sections, components */ ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   **Rules:**
   - `parts[0]` must be `artifact-organizer/Page`. Use `artifact-organizer/SlideDeck` only if user explicitly asked for slides (then use `/artifact-organizer:slides` instead).
   - `props` contains ONLY semantic data. NEVER specify colors, fonts, sizes, or layout classes.
   - Use `children` for container nesting (Page/Section).
   - Section `id` must be kebab-case (`[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*`).
   - Enum values are case-sensitive (e.g., Callout.severity: `info`, `warn`, etc., not `Warning`).
   - For repo explainers, the first content section should usually be diagram-led, not prose-led.
   - For repo explainers, use no more than 2 `Prose` blocks unless the user explicitly asks for prose-heavy output.
   - Avoid `Comparison` as the dominant visual for repo explainers unless the source is truly about alternatives or trade-offs.
   - Keep inline code readable. No more than 1-2 backticked spans per paragraph or list item.

4. **Render via CLI.** Invoke the bash wrapper with the JSON piped in:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.artifact-organizer/out
   SLUG="$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
   OUT=~/.artifact-organizer/out/$SLUG.html
   MODE_FLAG=""
   [ "$MODE" = "light" ] && MODE_FLAG="--mode light"
   [ "$MODE" = "dark" ]  && MODE_FLAG="--mode dark"

   cat <<'EOF' | ~/.claude/plugins/cache/artifact-organizer-marketplace/*/plugins/artifact-organizer/scripts/outprint --theme "$THEME" $MODE_FLAG --out "$OUT"
   <the JSON you built>
   EOF
   echo "$OUT"
   ```

   If the plugin is installed at a different path, use the actual path to `plugins/artifact-organizer/scripts/outprint` in the plugin cache. The `node plugins/artifact-organizer/scripts/render.mjs` direct invocation also works.

5. **Open in browser.**

   ```bash
   open "$OUT"    # macOS
   # xdg-open "$OUT"  # Linux
   ```

6. **Report to user.** Tell them:
   - The file path
   - Brief one-line summary of what was rendered (e.g. "3-section architecture overview with ArchitectureGrid + 2 Callouts")

## Error recovery

If the CLI exits with status 2 (schema validation failure), stderr contains lines like `parts[0].children[1].props.title: Missing required prop: title`. Read those paths, fix the JSON, and retry. Up to 2 retries. If still failing, report the errors + the JSON you tried to the user and ask for guidance.

## Avoid

- Styling hints in props (colors, layouts, spacing)
- ASCII art fallbacks — that is why this skill exists
- Giant single Prose blocks — break into Sections with Headings when there are multiple topics
- Mermaid for data tables — use DataTable
- DataTable for system diagrams — use Mermaid or ArchitectureGrid
- Repo explainers that read like essays with a decorative diagram attached
- Over-formatting technical nouns with backticks until the page texture gets noisy

## Quick component picker

| User says... | Use... |
|---|---|
| "Draw/diagram a system" | Mermaid (flowchart) or ArchitectureGrid |
| "Compare A and B" | Comparison |
| "Show steps to X" | StepList |
| "Recap / progression of X" | StepList or sectioned prose recap |
| "Metrics summary" | KPICards + Chart + DataTable |
| "Explain X" | Page + Sections + Prose + Callouts |
| "Review this diff" | use `/artifact-organizer:diff` |
| "Make slides about X" | use `/artifact-organizer:slides` |
